Depending on what IDE you are using you may have to specify that the resources folder as the root resource folder.

Load and New Game on the title screen do the same thing, I did not implement save files.

You can move the character around the map and navigate the menus using the Arrow Buttons or WASD.

P will open the pause menu.  In the pause menu you can use items on party members.

Enter is used to confirm a choice Backspace to cancel.

Battles happen randomly.  The transition from the map to the battle screen is sudden, as are the transitions between all the states if I had more time I would implement a transition state to help with this, but I do not have the time.

During battle on the right side there is a box that displays the current team's turns.
- Green boxes are normal turns.  Blue boxes are advantage turns.
- Hitting an enemy with an element it is weak to will earn you advantage points.  Hitting an enemy with something it is strong against will deduct a turn from you.
- Passing converts a normal turn into an advantage turn (think of it as using half a turn).
- You cannot gain advantage turns if there are no normal turns on the stack to replace.
- Normal turns are always used first.

The items option is present while in battle but I have not implemented it yet.

If dialogue appears press Enter to advance past it.

After a battle a battle results screen appears press Enter to continue.

When your character levels up a level up screen will appear where you have to allocate bonus points to stats of your choice.  You have to allocate all points.  Press Enter to confirm your choice.
